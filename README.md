### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications

- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
